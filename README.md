# **What I Learned Week 8**
## **Day 29**   

First couple days we went over hw and

Started new projects like the building dice app  

Middle of the week we learned FLEXBOX  

Holy grail layout  

Always do {display :flex}to parent element of what you want  


The flex container properties are:

flex-direction  

flex-wrap  

flex-flow  

justify-content  

align-items  

align-content  

https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ is a great guide to using flex box


flex-direction: choose row or column  

justify content: space-evenly (or whatever) you want it to do on the above choice  

Align-item: center (or whatever) will do stuff on the opposite axis

At the end of the week we just went over assignments and set up mobile classroom for Monday.
